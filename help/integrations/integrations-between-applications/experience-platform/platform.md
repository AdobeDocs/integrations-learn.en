# Integrate Experience Platform with other Adobe applications

Adobe Experience Platform is the most powerful, flexible, and open system on the market for building and managing complete solutions that drive customer experience. Many new Adobe Applications have been built on top of Experience Platform, including:

* Customer Journey Analytics
* Journey Optimizer
* Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP)

Integrating applications with _multiple Platform-native applications_ share many common steps, but different use cases are unlocked depending on which applications you are integrating. The integration content is therefore organized by application. Please see the resources below.
