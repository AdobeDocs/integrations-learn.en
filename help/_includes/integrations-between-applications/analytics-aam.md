# Analytics and Audience Manager integration

{{analytics-description}}

{{audience-manager-description}}

Enabling this integration, by forwarding Adobe Analytics data server-side to Audience Manager, gives Audience Manager one of its major sources of data, namely online customer behavioral data. This data can then be combined with other data, like first-party CRM data or third-party partner data, to create rich customer segments. In addition, Audience Manager segments are then sent back to the webpage in the response for further visitor analysis. Both of these valuable use cases are described below.

The key benefits of integrating Adobe Analytics and Audience Manager are:

+ **Enhanced segmentation**: Combine Adobe Analytics & Audience Manager data for precise, personalized audience segments in marketing campaigns.
+ **Unified customer profiles**: Integrate data sources to understand interactions and behaviors, creating comprehensive customer profiles.
+ **Improved ad effectiveness**: Optimize ads with data-driven targeting from Adobe Analytics & Audience Manager integration.
+ **Data-driven decisions**: Inform choices through detailed insights, merging Adobe Analytics & Audience Manager data.
+ **Personalized experiences**: Tailor your content & offers, enriching customer interactions across touch-points using both platforms.

Overall, the integration of Adobe Analytics and Audience Manager brings together valuable data and audience insights, enabling businesses to create more targeted and relevant marketing campaigns while gaining a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and behaviors.
