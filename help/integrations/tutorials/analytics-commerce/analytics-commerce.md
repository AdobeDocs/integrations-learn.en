1. Create a new report suite in Adobe [!DNL Analytics], or identify the ID of the report suite that you will be pushing [!DNL Commerce] data into. For more info, watch a tutorial on [creating a new report suite](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-learn/tutorials/intro-to-analytics/analytics-basics/understanding-and-creating-report-suites.html). You will need this report suite ID in the datastream step below.

1. Navigate to the [Adobe Experience [!DNL Platform] interface](https://platform.adobe.com) if you have access to Experience [!DNL Platform]. If you don't have access to that interface, you can perform all necessary steps listed below in the Adobe Experience [!DNL Platform] [Data Collection interface](https://experience.adobe.com/#/data-collection).

1. Create or update your XDM schema with [!DNL Commerce]-specific field groups. For more information on how to create a schema, please see the ["Create schemas"](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/schemas/create-schemas.html) tutorial.  
    * You will need to select this schema from the options in the datastream step below. To create a schema, Look in the left column under **Data Management** and find **Schemas**. Now on the top right of the interface, click **Create schema**. Select XDM ExperienceEvent.
    * After creating a new schema, you will add the [!DNL Commerce] field groups. On the left side of the UI, find Field groups, and click **Add**
        * In the search, you can filter by entering `ExperienceEvent Commerce`
        * Select the **Adobe [!DNL Analytics] ExperienceEvent [!DNL Commerce]** by checking the box
        * Then click **Add field groups** on the top right to save and continue

1. Optionally (and only if you are in the Experience [!DNL Platform] interface) - Create a new dataset
    * This step allows you to bring the [!DNL Commerce] data into the Experience [!DNL Platform] (separately from bring the data into Adobe [!DNL Analytics]). Do this step if you have access to Experience [!DNL Platform], and are planning to use the [!DNL Commerce] data in the Experience [!DNL Platform]-supported applications, like Real-Time Customer Data [!DNL Platform], Customer Journey [!DNL Analytics], or Journey Optimizer.   
    * You will need to select this dataset from the options in the datastream step below.
    * Under the left column **Data Management** heading in the left navigation, select **Datasets**.  
    * Click **Create dataset** in the top right. Choose the **Create dataset from schema** option.  
    * Search for and use the schema that you created in the last step

1. Create the Datastream to send the [!DNL Commerce] data to Adobe [!DNL Analytics]
    * Under the **Data Collection** heading in the left column, select **Datastreams**.
    * Click **New Datastream** on the top right of the interface.
    * Provide a name and and optional description.
    * Find and select the schema that you created/identified in the previous step.
    * Add any desired advanced options. For more information about the advanced options, please visit the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/datastreams/configure.html).
    * Click **Save** to continue.
    * Click **Add Service** and choose **Adobe [!DNL Analytics]** in the drop-down field.
    * Click **Add Report Suite** and enter the report suite ID that you created/identified in a previous step. You can add more than one report suite if you would like the data to flow into multiple report suites.
    * Optionally, and if you created a dataset in a previous step, click **Add Service** again, choosing **Adobe Experience [!DNL Platform]** from the drop-down field. In the Event Dataset field, select the dataset that you previously created.
    * Save the Datastream.

1. Finally, to view your [!DNL Commerce] data, you will need to navigate to Analysis Workspace in Adobe [!DNL Analytics], create a project, choose your report suite, and add freeform tables and other visualizations to report on and analyze your [!DNL Commerce] data. The following image shows one example of a table you can create in Analysis Workspace.
