We also have two step-by-step tutorials showing you the details for setting up A4T reports in Analysis Workspace for "auto-allocate" and "auto-target" activities:

## Setting up A4T reports in Analysis Workspace for Auto-Allocate activities {#a4t-auto-allocate}

An Auto-Allocate activity identifies a winner among two or more experiences and automatically reallocates more traffic to the winner while the test continues to run and learn. The [!DNL Analytics] for [!DNL Target] (A4T) integration for Auto-Allocate allows you to see your reporting data in Adobe [!DNL Analytics], and you can even optimize for custom events or metrics defined in [!DNL Analytics].

## Setting up A4T reports in Analysis Workspace for Auto-[!DNL Target] activities {#a4t-auto-target}

The [!DNL Analytics] for [!DNL Target] (A4T) integration for Auto-[!DNL Target] activities uses the Adobe [!DNL Target] ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithms to choose the best experience for each visitor based on their profile, behavior, and context, all while using an Adobe [!DNL Analytics] goal metric.

Although rich analysis capabilities are available in Adobe [!DNL Analytics] Analysis Workspace, a few modifications to the default [!DNL Analytics] for [!DNL Target] panel are required to correctly interpret Auto-[!DNL Target] activities, due to differences between experimentation activities (manual A/B Test and Auto-Allocate) and personalization activities (Auto-[!DNL Target]).
