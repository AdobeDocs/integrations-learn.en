>[!NOTE]

>The standard workflow steps for the Adobe [!DNL Analytics] source connector create the schema and dataset used to ingest the data from [!DNL Analytics] "as-is". Therefore, the first two steps are handled by the system. The mapping workflow requires creating custom attributes; therefore, follow the sequence of steps fully.
