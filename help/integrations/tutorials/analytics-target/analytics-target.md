## Common use cases

The videos below show different features, activity types, and benefits of integrating via A4T.

We also have two step-by-step tutorials showing you the details for setting up A4T reports in Analysis Workspace for "auto-allocate" and "auto-target" activities:

## Setting up A4T reports in Analysis Workspace for Auto-Allocate activities {#a4t-auto-allocate}

An Auto-Allocate activity identifies a winner among two or more experiences and automatically reallocates more traffic to the winner while the test continues to run and learn. The Analytics for Target (A4T) integration for Auto-Allocate allows you to see your reporting data in Adobe Analytics, and you can even optimize for custom events or metrics defined in Analytics.

## Setting up A4T reports in Analysis Workspace for Auto-Target activities {#a4t-auto-target}

The Analytics for Target (A4T) integration for Auto-Target activities uses the Adobe Target ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithms to choose the best experience for each visitor based on their profile, behavior, and context, all while using an Adobe Analytics goal metric.

Although rich analysis capabilities are available in Adobe Analytics Analysis Workspace, a few modifications to the default Analytics for Target panel are required to correctly interpret Auto-Target activities, due to differences between experimentation activities (manual A/B Test and Auto-Allocate) and personalization activities (Auto-Target).
